# AceStacks v2
A compact, easy-to-assemble SlimeVR tracker design using a PCB with attached sensor and charge circuitry, and the commonly available 16340 battery.

# Overview
AceStacks V2 is a compact, easy-to-assemble SlimeVR tracker design using a PCB with attached sensor and charge circuitry, a D1 Mini, and the commonly available 16340 battery. Here are some of the standout features of the AceStacks trackers.

- The use of the included pin sockets of the D1 Mini allows the MCU to mount over other components, resulting in a compact PCB footprint.
- The design of the board reduces the number of pin headers that need to be trimmed, one of the more annoying parts of DIY trackers with PCBs.
- 16340 cells are easier to obtain (in the United States, not sure about the rest of the world), relatively cheap, more durable compared to li-po pouch cells, and hot swappable if you need more battery life
- This arrangement allows for a compact full body tracker with ~8 hours of battery life, battery sense, AUX tracker support, and a hot swappable battery.
